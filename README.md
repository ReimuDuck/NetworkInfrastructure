# NetworkInfrastructure
  Using Docker Compose there are currently 3 containers being ran by an optiplex 7050
    a Navidrome service to stream music, a Minecraft server, and Homepage for future ease of access

  Goals for this server are to centralize all my important files and any other service I require.
    FUTURE PLANS:
      Add password manager.
      Add photo archive
      Add easily accessible network drive.
      Add movie service.
      Add wiki
